  description "This simple cartridge is the ammunition for the Gatling Gun, with a projectile of depleted nuclear fuel or an illuminated tracer round. Since this ammunition is primarily manufactured on pirate worlds by slave children in poor working conditions, muzzle velocity can vary by up to 30%, and tracer distribution is seldom uniform."

  description `When Dr. Richard J. Gatling invented the rapid-fire gun bearing his name in the 19th Century A.D., he hoped that its destructiveness would lead to the end of war itself. Over a millennium later, this modern incarnation of the gatling gun sees action in the stars, a testament to its fundamentally robust design - and Dr. Gatling's naivete. While capable of a high fire rate, this gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`

  description "The Sidewinder Missile is designed by Lovelace Labs, which is ironically also the designer of the Heavy Anti-Missile turret. Rumours say that the two engineering teams at Lovelace who make the missiles and the anti-missiles are locked in furious competition with each other: the result has been generation after generation of smarter missiles and then smarter turrets to fend them off."
  description "  Although not as powerful or cheap as the popular Meteor missiles, Sidewinders have several advantages, including their superior manoeuvrability, better tracking systems, and protective casings that make them much harder for anti-missile systems to destroy."

  description "Centuries ago, space battles were fought mostly with missiles, with the outcome dependent only on which ship had more shielding or ammunition. Lovelace Labs was originally founded to remedy that situation by developing a protective system that could shoot missiles out of the air, defending freighter convoys from pirates who could otherwise simply bombard them into submission without ever venturing within range of their guns. The only way to overcome it is by firing missiles in a cluster so that while one is being targeted, the others can get through, and as a result all missile systems on the market now default to firing in clusters if multiple copies of the same launcher are installed, rather than staggering their fire as ordinary guns do."
