	description "Several years ago, while visiting a sweat lodge in search of spiritual renewal, Tarazed's chief ship designer fell into a trance and journeyed to a reality separate from our own. There he saw visions of a strange and elegant starship. Returning to his work with renewed purpose, he spent the next seven years making the Kestrel a reality."
