Torpedo launchers are also much larger than other missile systems, so they are most often found in capital ships."

However, they are also much slower, because they are intended mostly for use against large and slow-moving capital ships. As a result, sufficiently skilled pilots can often dodge around them."

It is mostly intended for larger ships, where energy and space are plentiful, but some pilots consider a single Heavy Laser to be a worthwhile alternative to a pair of ordinary lasers, because the longer range makes up for the fact that it does slightly less than twice as much damage."
