  description "After their Quicksilver light warship with its armament of particle cannons became a large success with convoy escorts and planetary defense forces, Megaparsec decided to develop a larger ship with similar maneuverability but heavier firepower. The Manta is the result: a ship with enough long-range firepower that fleeing from a battle with it is almost impossible."

  description "The Megaparsec Quicksilver is a warship built around a single concept: to design the smallest and fastest ship capable of carrying two particle cannons. Because of its speed and long weapons range, the Quicksilver can keep a safe distance from most targets and bombard them with particle bursts until they are destroyed."

  description "The Splinter is the largest warship produced by the Megaparsec shipyard.
