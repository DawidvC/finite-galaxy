  description "These crystals, mined on the Remnant planet Viminal, can store a surprising amount of power in a compact form. Crystals pure enough to be used in such a manner are hard to find, however."
  description "  Also, the capacitors tend to leak small amounts of energy, in the form of excess heat."
