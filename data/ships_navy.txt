  description "The Jupiter is more than just a warship: it is practically a mobile space station, with docking bays for an entire squadron of drones and fighters and enough crew to fill a small village. Although designed primarily for engaging enemies from a distance, a Jupiter can also do significant damage in close combat."

  description "The Mercury is a missile boat built in the Republic Navy Yard. It comes equipped with four missile launchers and enough ammunition to destroy even ships many times its size. Because of their lack of manoeuvrability and relatively light shielding, Mercury serve best as long-range attack ships, and once their missile supply is spent, they are relatively useless in combat."
