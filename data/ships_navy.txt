  description "For centuries, the Mars was the largest warship produced by the Republic Navy Yard, but now they seem quite small compared to a Venus or a Saturn. Armed with a variety of weapons, and with relatively good manoeuvrability for a ship its size, the Mars is equally capable at fending off small fighters or bombarding larger ships."
