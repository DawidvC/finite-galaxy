  description "The Argosy from Vortex Shipyards is very popular with merchants not because of its capacity, which is actually slightly smaller than the Star Freighter, but because it can hold its own in combat against pirate interceptors."
  description "  The Argosy is also a very easy ship to upgrade with faster engines or more powerful weapons as needed, so many privately owned Argosies have very different capabilities than the stock model."

  description "The Warrior is one of the most affordable ships designed by Lionheart: a versatile ship that can serve equally well for escorting freighters or for bounty hunting. As with many of Lionheart's designs, the hull is mostly composite fiber rather than metal, sacrificing armour strength for the sake of lighter weight and faster movement."
