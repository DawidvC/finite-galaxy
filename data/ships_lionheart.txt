  description "The Headhunter is one of the newest ships designed by Lionheart: a versatile ship that can serve equally well for carrying valuable cargo, escorting freighters, or bounty hunting. It is capable of overtaking and defeating most other interceptors, such as the Berserker, hence its name. As with all of Lionheart's designs, the Headhunter's hull is mostly composite fiber rather than metal, sacrificing armour strength for the sake of lighter weight and faster movement. "

  description "The Lionheart Scoutship was designed back in the days when the galaxy was more sparsely populated, and ships prospecting for habitable worlds or worlds rich in resources would often travel far away from any habitable ports where they would be able to refuel. Although the galaxy has now been much more thoroughly explored, the Scout remains a popular ship for long-distance travel."
