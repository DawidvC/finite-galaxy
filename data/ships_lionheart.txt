  description "The Lionheart Bactrian is the last of the great city-ships, a design hearkening back to the early days of space colonization when a long-distance vessel needed to be a self-contained world, able to survive for weeks at a time without encountering an inhabited planet. It is not only a freighter, but a carrier, and a capable warship either at short range or at a distance. Naturally, this versatility also makes it extremely expensive, and the Bactrian is not normally for sale to ordinary citizens who have not been vetted by the local government of the Deep."

  description `The design of the Barb seems to be a Mule condensed to the level of a Dagger, and as you look at the cockpit nestled between the massive gun port and turret mount, you wonder where the power systems are supposed to go. Needless to say, there is no room for a hyperdrive, fuel barrels, and cargo. The Barb is categorized as a bomber rather than a fighter, because of its relatively high weapon space, and because its awkward shape makes it unable to fit into ordinary fighter bays. Though its operation range is currently rather limited, it seems flexible enough to become a dangerous addition to warfleets, if ever any bomber carriers will be designed.`
