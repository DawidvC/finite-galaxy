  description "The Lionheart Bounder was designed back in the days when the galaxy was more sparsely populated, and ships prospecting for habitable worlds or worlds rich in resources would often travel far away from any habitable ports where they would be able to refuel. Although the galaxy has now been much more thoroughly explored, the Bounder remains a popular ship for long-distance travel."

  description "The Bulk Freighter is the ultimate freighter, able to carry more cargo than any other human ship. It is also, however, an incredibly slow ship and difficult to manoeuvre, especially when fully loaded. Some freight caravans use multiple smaller freighters instead of bulk freighters just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Bulk Freighter to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."
