  description "The Syndicate CT-50 Star Barge is little more than a cluster of cargo containers with an engine at one end and a cockpit on the other. It is a slow and ugly ship, but it can carry enough cargo to earn its captain a steady income even in parts of the galaxy where it is hard to find passengers to carry or courier missions."
  description "  Because they often carry valuable cargo, and because they are too slow to evade any attackers, Star Barges are a common target of pirates."

  description "The Star Freighter is designed by Syndicate's Star Shipyards to be an efficient means of carrying cargo from system to system, but is so slow and difficult to land that most pilots hate flying them."
  description "  Freighters are an obvious target for pirates, but turn much too slowly to be able to bring any forward-facing guns to bear on an approaching enemy. As a result, the latest model is equipped only with turrets, including anti-missile turrets to prevent attackers from simply bombarding them into submission from a safe distance."
