Variations on this same ship design have been in use in the Core for almost half a millennium, but this model comes with the very latest in generator and weapon technology."

  description "The Heavy Shuttle is an updated shuttle model from Vortex Shipyards, attempting to improve on their perennial classic by offering slightly better cargo and passenger capacity, at the expense of some speed and manoeuvrability."
  description "  Shuttles are not designed to withstand combat of any sort, but they are fast and manoeuvrable enough to get out of harm's way if attacked by a larger, slower ship."

  description "Although Vortex Shipyards produces other ship models as well, the majority of their profits come from sales of the Light Shuttle. This versatile ship serves equally well as a passenger transport or a cargo courier. It also happens to be the cheapest ship you can buy which is capable of hyperspace travel."
