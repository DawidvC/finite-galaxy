  description "This weapon was originally developed in an attempt to reverse engineer a long-range energy projectile favoured by an alien species that the Remnant encountered nearby. In the process they discovered that by adding more energy to the projectiles they could do a lot more damage in exchange for shorter range, and the Thrasher Cannon was born."

  description `Nearly a century ago, a Remnant scout exploring space north of the Ember Waste came under fire from an alien fleet armed with weapons that interfered with the scout's engines. The story says that the Remnant captain calmly told her crew, "We aren't going home until we steal that weapon." That alien technology became the basis of the Inhibitor Cannon.`

  description "Not long after the Remnant settled on Aventine, they began to discover caches of alien technology in vaults deep under the mountains, guarded by ancient but still-functioning point-defence systems. The Remnant learned how to duplicate those defence systems, and they are now considered to be much more useful than most of the items that they were guarding."
