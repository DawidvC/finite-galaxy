  "jump speed" .2
  "jump fuel" 1000
  "hyperdrive" 1
  description "This mysterious box sits quietly at the heart of your ship, thinking its own inscrutable thoughts. When it comes time to travel between the stars it sets off a nuclear fusion reaction powerful enough to level an entire city, and then somehow tucks the resulting explosion in between the folds of regular space-time like a wasp stinging an oak leaf to lay her eggs inside. Your ship rides the resulting ripple in the fabric of space."
  description "  Although the blue prints are in the public domain throughout human space, they say that fewer than a dozen human beings alive today understand the inner workings of the hyperdrive. Most shipyards simply keep a stock of finished hyperdrives imported from Earth."

  "scram drive" .2
  "jump fuel" 1500
  "hyperdrive" 1
  description "A Scram Drive is a specially designed hyperdrive that works even if your ship is travelling at a much higher speed, at the expense of using more fuel. If you are being pursued by pirates (or just want to get somewhere in a hurry) that extra bit of speed can make a big difference."

  "jump speed" .3
  "jump fuel" 2000
  "jump drive" 1
  description "The workings of the Jump Drive are a total mystery. The best that human scientists have been able to find out is that this device is a containment field for matter in a state that cannot normally exist in this universe; if the drive is opened up, the field collapses and its contents disappear. Therefore, even though a few jump drives have been captured over the years, it has so far proved impossible to reverse engineer them."

  cost 2000
  "mass" 1
  "outfit space" -1
  "fuel capacity" 100
  description "A fuel barrel is tiny and thus increases your fuel capacity by only a small amount, therefore you need large numbers of them for each hyperspace jump."

  cost 25000
  "mass" 8
  "outfit space" -8
  "fuel capacity" 1000

    Korath
  cost 400000
  "mass" 30
  "outfit space" -30
  "fuel capacity" 4000
  "ramscoop" 1
  description "The fuel processor was developed during the latter half of the Korath Civil War, when Korath factions attempted to provide for their war effort by raiding the Hai for supplies. Their ships would often end up stranded after they had run out of fuel and were unable to escape from the Hai military fleets, prompting the creation of this hybrid fuel storage and ramscoop device. These outfits are now the main source of fuel for the remaining Korath in the galaxy."

  "required crew" 1
  "automaton" -1
  "energy consumption" .02
  description "In response to occasional raids by the robotic war machines left behind after their recent conflict, the Kor Efret have developed this minimal, spartan command centre that can be installed in a captured robotic ship to allow a pilot to override the AI and interface with the ship's controls. The command centre only provides a single bunk for the captain, so more may be necessary if the ship has turrets or other systems that require crew."

outfit "Control Transceiver"
  category "Systems"
  thumbnail "outfit/control_transceiver"
  cost "7000"
  "mass" 1
  "outfit space" -1
  "plunderable" 1
  description "This is a miniaturized communication device, which can be connected to all the major systems of a Kor Sestor automaton, apparently as a way of controlling them remotely. The communications are encrypted and authenticated in a way that would make it nearly impossible to spoof the control signals."

outfit "Quantum Keystone"

  cost 12000
  "mass" 1
  "outfit space" -1
  "quantum keystone" 1
  description "This chunk of rock from the mountains on the Hai homeworld is apparently nothing more than a good luck charm, but the Hai have decorated their ships with them since the height of their empire. More superstitious Hai claim that the stones somehow reduce the nausea induced by hyperspace jumps by making travel between star systems easier."

  "outfit space" -1
  "quantum keystone" 1
  description "This precious artifact attunes a ship's quantum oscillations in a way that allows it to travel through certain otherwise impassible wormholes in the Ember Waste. The stones are rare and valuable, because they can only be mined from one location in the Waste."

  "self destruct" .01
  description "This is some sort of advanced, miniature computer combined with various sensor inputs and a hyperspace communication relay. Presumably, in some way it controls the Mereti automata or allows them to more easily coordinate their actions with each other."

  cost 320000
  "mass" 16
  "outfit space" -16
  "ramscoop" 7
  description "Ramscoop technology has been almost unchanged for centuries, because with nearly every system in human space settled there has not been a pressing need for ships to harvest their own fuel. But with the Free Worlds war making travel once again more difficult, some engineers in the Tarazed recently invented a much-improved ramscoop for use in their merchant fleets."

  "ramscoop" 0.5
  description "The Ember Waste is the sort of place where only a very foolish captain would travel without some sort of device for replenishing hyperspace fuel. This ramscoop is not particularly powerful, but it allows a ship to explore without fear of getting stranded."

  "mass" 10
  "outfit space" -10
  "ramscoop" 1
  description "In the early days of space exploration, when ships could travel through half a dozen systems before encountering an established colony where they could refuel, ramscoops were an essential piece of equipment, harvesting plasma from the solar wind to refill your hyperspace fuel tanks. Although you can install more than one ramscoop, additional ramscoops on a single ship are not as effective as the first."
  description "  (As a safety measure, all ships are able to harvest tiny amounts of fuel by flying close to a star, but this outfit allows you to accumulate fuel much more quickly. The closer you are to the star, the faster fuel will accumulate.)"
