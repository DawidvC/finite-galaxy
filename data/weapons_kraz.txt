  description "A crude but impressive-looking weapon, the Flamethrower ignites your hyperspace fuel and directs a stream of it towards your adversaries. The damage it does is relatively minor, but it can be useful for causing a target that is already operating near its thermal capacity to overheat, temporarily taking it out of the fight."

  description "This jury-rigged weapon is a turbocharged version of the Modified Blaster Turret, mounting double the number of guns and fed with an even higher energy input. The crystals glow and crackle with power, and from 20 feet away you can feel the heat they're giving off. Each of these formidable turrets would likely require a dedicated cooling system to prevent its ship from going into thermal shutdown."
