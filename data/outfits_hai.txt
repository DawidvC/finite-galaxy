  description "The Hai Diamond Shield Regenerator is an advanced type of shield recharging technology. Unfortunately, its power needs are quite high, and the shifts it makes to your shield matrix causes intense heat at the regenerator when your shields are charging. The Hai usually employ Williwaw Cooling when they use this regenerator."
