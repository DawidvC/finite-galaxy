  description "The Bulk Freighter is the ultimate cargo ship, able to carry as much cargo as four ordinary Star Freighters. It is also, however, an incredibly slow ship and difficult to manoeuvre, especially when loaded down with cargo. Some freight caravans use multiple smaller freighters instead of bulk freighters just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Bulk Freighter to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."

  description `Voted the "ugliest ship in the sky" by Stars and Starships Magazine, the Protector is a typical example of brutally efficient Syndicate engineering. It is basically nothing more than six blaster turrets attached to a set of engines and crew's quarters, designed as a defence platform that can accompany merchant convoys.`

  description `The Vanguard is Betelgeuse's newest warship intended for the heavy anti-pirate defence market. Vanguards offer an unusual feature set, focusing on powerful fixed guns and featuring Syndicated Systems' latest automation technologies, resulting in an atypically low crew complement for a ship its size. Few capital ships will endure for long under the withering fusillade of gunfire that it can unleash against those in front of it.`

  description "The Warrior is Betelgeuse Shipyard's most popular design of escort ship. They have greater firepower than most other interceptor-class vessel, meaning that any pirate flying solo will think twice before attacking a convoy that is accompanied by a Warrior. However, Warriors are also much less manoeuvrable than other small ships."
