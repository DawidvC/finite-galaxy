  description "The Bulk Freighter is the ultimate cargo ship, able to carry as much more cargo than any other human ship. It is also, however, an incredibly slow ship and difficult to manoeuvre, especially when loaded down with cargo. Some freight caravans use multiple smaller freighters instead of bulk freighters just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Bulk Freighter to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."
