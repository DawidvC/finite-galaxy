  description "The Aerie is a light carrier, designed to be just big enough for two fighter bays plus a decent armament of its own. Variations on this same ship design have been in use in the Core for almost half a millennium, but this model comes with the very latest in generator and weapon technology."

  description "The Argosy from Vortex Shipyards is very popular with merchants not because of its capacity, which is actually slightly smaller than the Star Freighter, but because it can hold its own in combat against pirate interceptors."
  description "  The Argosy is also a very easy ship to upgrade with faster engines or more powerful weapons as needed, so many privately owned Argosies have very different capabilities than the stock model."

  description "The Dagger is a fighter designed by Betelgeuse, intended to be carried by their Aerie warship, although other ships have been known to carry them, as well. As with many Betelgeuse ships, its chassis is largely composed of lightweight composite materials, making it considerably faster than other fighters."

  description "Once one of the most popular interceptor-class ships, the Hero's popularity is now waning in favour of more modern and versatile ships like the Hawk. Although large numbers are still produced by Betelgeuse Shipyards, many other Heroes that are in service today are more than half a century old."

  description `Voted the "ugliest ship in the sky" by Stars and Starships Magazine, the Protector is a typical example of brutally efficient Syndicate engineering. It is basically nothing more than six blaster turrets attached to a set of engines and crew's quarters, designed as a defence platform that can accompany merchant convoys.`

  description "The Vanguard is Betelgeuse's newest warship intended for the heavy anti-pirate defence market. Vanguards offer an unusual feature set, focusing on powerful fixed guns and featuring Syndicated Systems' latest automation technologies, resulting in an atypically low crew complement for a ship its size. Few capital ships will endure for long under the withering fusillade of gunfire that it can unleash against those in front of it."
