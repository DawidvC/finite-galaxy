  description "This is the standard shield generator for fighters and interceptors, as well as for many non-combat starships. Although it is possible for a ship to have no shield generator at all, recharging its shield matrix only when landed in a hospitable spaceport, life in deep space is unpredictable enough that most pilots find shield generators to be well worth the space they take up."

  description "This is a slightly more powerful shield generator than the standard model installed in most small ships. If combat lasts long enough, the increased recharge rate is enough to give you an edge, but recharging your shields completely will still take a long time."

  description "This is a more powerful shield generator designed for ships that are likely to see frequent combat, or that have such a large shield capacity that recharging them would take a long time with a smaller generator."

  description "This is the most powerful shield generator available in human space. Because of their large size, D94-YV shield generators are mostly used in large warships, but you can fit one in a smaller ship if you are willing to sacrifice engine power or weaponry to make space for it."

  "energy consumption" .3
  "heat generation" 2
  description "A shield regenerator works by subtly modifying the geometry of your shield matrix in order to make your shields more malleable and therefore much easier to recharge. Unfortunately, this causes your shields to also become less efficient, which draws energy away from your other systems, even when not charging shields, and creates heat."

  description "The S-970 Shield Regenerator is an advanced type of shield recharging technology. Unfortunately, its power needs are rather high, and the shifts it makes in your shield configuration also result in some feedback that causes heat to build up in the regenerator, even when your shields are at full strength."

  description "This is a relatively large fuel cell. Other generators are available that produce more energy and fit into a smaller space, but they are much more expensive. As a result, large civilian ships that will not be frequently in combat often come equipped with these fuel cells."

  description "Nucleovoltaic generators are a relatively recent generator technology that harvests energy from the decay of a radioisotope source and converts it directly into electricity. They are the most powerful generator that relies on nuclear decay instead of an active nuclear chain reaction."

  description "A breeder reactor is a more efficient fission reactor that captures some of the neutron radiation produced by the reactor and uses it to enrich more fuel. They are also, of course, bigger and more expensive as a result."
