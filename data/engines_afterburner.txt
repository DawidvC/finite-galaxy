	description "An afterburner works by dumping hyperspace fuel into your engines and igniting it, producing a large amount of thrust. This can be very useful for dodging missiles or briefly escaping from faster opponents, but you must be careful to avoid using up so much fuel that you do not have enough left for hyperspace travel."

	description "The ionic afterburner was designed by the Syndicate to compensate for the primary weakness of an ordinary afterburner: namely, that it consumes hyperspace fuel at a prodigious rate. Ionic afterburners instead use a small amount of fuel combined with a large burst of energy from your ship's batteries to achieve the same effect."
