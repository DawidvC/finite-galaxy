	description "Coalition engineers prefer to focus on perfecting a few versatile designs rather than producing a wide range of them. This thruster is quite efficient, but large ships will need several of them stacked together to produce sufficient thrust."

	description "By focusing on small, modular engines rather than the massive capital ship drives that most other species develop, the Coalition loses some of the potential efficiency for very large ships, but gains a considerable amount of flexibility."
