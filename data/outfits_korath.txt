  description "The fuel processor was developed during the latter half of the Korath Civil War, when Korath factions attempted to provide for their war effort by raiding the Hai for supplies. Their ships would often end up stranded after they had run out of fuel and were unable to escape from the Hai military fleets, prompting the creation of this hybrid fuel storage and ramscoop device. These outfits are now the main source of fuel for the remaining Korath in the galaxy."

The command centre only provides a single bunk for the captain, so more may be necessary if the ship has turrets or other systems that require crew."

  "capture attack" 1.6
  "capture defense" 2.4
  description "This rifle is commonplace among the Korath, predating the creation of the Repeater by at least two centuries. As it uses superheated plasma instead of lasers, the rifle is slow to fire and can sometimes burn its user's hands if they aren't careful. It makes up for these setbacks by guaranteeing that those hit won't live long enough to fire back."
