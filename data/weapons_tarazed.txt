  description "Heavy Rockets are the most powerful missile weapon available, but at a price: instead of having a homing system, they simply fire straight forward and rely on a proximity trigger to set them off. Once triggered, however, they damage all ships within their blast radius, making them highly effective against clusters of fighters."
