## Contributions
Contributions are welcome; anyone can contribute; feel free to open issues or make pull requests.

### Posting issues

The [issues page](https://github.com/finite-galaxy/finite-galaxy/issues) on GitHub is for tracking bugs and for art, content, and feature requests. When posting a new issue, please:

* Be polite and always assume good faith.
* Check to make sure it's not a duplicate of an existing issue.
* Create a separate "issue" for each bug and each request.

If requesting a new feature, first ask yourself: will this make the game more fun or interesting? Remember that this is a game, not a simulator. Changes will not be made purely for the sake of realism, especially if they introduce needless complexity or aggravation.

If you believe your issue has been resolved, you can close the issue yourself.

### Posting pull requests

If you are posting a pull request, please:

* Do not combine multiple unrelated changes into a single pull.
* Check the diff and make sure the pull request does not contain unintended changes.
* If changing the C++ code, follow the [coding standard](http://endless-sky.github.io/styleguide/styleguide.xml).
* Do not use tabs; use two spaces instead.
* Use Oxford spelling (the variant of English used by many scientific journals and international organizations such as the United Nations), instead of American, British, Canadian, or other national varieties.

If proposing a major pull request, start by posting an issue and discussing the best way to implement it. Often the first strategy that occurs to you will not be the cleanest or most effective way to implement a new feature.
